# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

'Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

A task was given by a Calarado Board of Elections employee in order to create a python program that may tally election result of a local congresstional election.

The orginal design of this file was meant to obtain:

  * The total votes cast
  * The list of candidates
  * The total votes per candidate
  * The percentage of votes per candidate
  * The winner of the election

However, in addition to the orginal design, the election commission requestion more information:
  
  * The voter turnout per county
  * The percentage of voters per county
  * The county with the highest voter turnout
  
To perform these tasks, Python version 3.7 (64 bit) was used; we were also given the list of the election results to work with (located in resources folder).
