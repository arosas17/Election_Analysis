# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

A task was given by a Calarado Board of Elections employee in order to create a python program that may tally election result of a local congresstional election.

The orginal design of this file was meant to obtain:

  * The total votes cast
  * The list of candidates
  * The total votes per candidate
  * The percentage of votes per candidate
  * The winner of the election

However, in addition to the orginal design, the election commission requestion more information:
  
  * The voter turnout per county
  * The percentage of voters per county
  * The county with the highest voter turnout
  
To perform these tasks, Python version 3.7 (64 bit) and Visual Studio Code version 1.69.1 were used; we were also given the list of the election results to work with (located in resources folder).


## Election-Audit Results 

Based on the results recieved:

* There was a total of 369,711 votes casted in this election.

* The candidates are:
     - Chareles Casper Stockham
     - Diana DeGette
     - Raymon Anthony Doane

* The candidates' vote results are as follow:
     - Chareles Casper Stockham recieved 23.0% of the votes, totaling 85,213 votes.
     - Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the votes, totaling 272,892 votes.
     - Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the votes, totaling 11,606 votes.

* The winner is Diana DeGette who recieved 73.8% of the votes, a vote count of 272,892.

Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.


Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

Which county had the largest number of votes?

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

## Summary

In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
